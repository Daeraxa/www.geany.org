## Supporting users

There are different ways you can support Geany users. Yes, even supporting users is a contribution to the Geany project.

### Geany-users mailing list

You can subscribe to the [Geany Users mailing list][1] and answer questions, give hints to people who write there and so on.

### IRC

There are many people who join IRC and ask questions. You can join us on [#geany][2] on chat.freenode.net and help out answering questions there.

### Bug Zapping

You can also surf through the bugs reported at the [Github issue tracker][3] and see if you maybe can help users. Some issues reported are not actually bugs and maybe can be solved with your help.

### Twitter
