Donate to the Geany project
==========

Donations are always welcome and help to support the development of Geany.

There are many ways of donating to the Geany project.
More than financial support, the Geany project needs help with:
- [Translations][1]
- [Documentation][2]
- [Supporting users][3]
- [Implementing new features and fixing bugs][4]


### Financial support

If you want to donate money to the Geany project, it will be used to support further development of Geany, to pay running costs for hosting and domains and support presenting Geany on various [Open Source Conferences][5].

Currently, the only available option to donate money is via Paypal. We are working on more options.
