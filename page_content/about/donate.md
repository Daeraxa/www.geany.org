Donate to the Geany project
==========

Donations are always welcome and help to support the development of Geany.

There are many ways of donating to the Geany project.
More than financial support, the Geany project needs help with:
- [Translations][1]
- [Documentation][2]
- [Supporting users][3]
- [Implementing new features and fixing bugs][4]


### Financial support

If you want to donate money to the Geany project, it will be used to support further development of Geany, to pay running costs for hosting and domains and support presenting Geany on various [Open Source Conferences][5].

Currently, there are two options to donate money: via bank transfer and Paypal.
Bank transfer to the [Geany e.V.][8] account is the preferred way for donating money as the money is transferred directly without a third party involved and Paypal fees can be avoided.

Your options:

  - Bank transfer:
    Account holder: Geany e.V.
    IBAN: DE94830944950003429687
    BIC: GENODEF1ETK
