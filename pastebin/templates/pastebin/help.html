<h3>What is pastebin?</h3>
<p>This pastebin is here to help you collaborate on debugging code snippets. If you're not familiar with the idea,
most people use it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="{% url 'home' %}">submit</a> a code fragment to pastebin,
getting a url like http://{{ request.site.domain }}/abc1234</li>
<li>paste the url into an IRC or IM conversation</li>
<li>someone responds by reading and perhaps submitting a modification of your code</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can I delete a post?</h3>
<p>Your posted snippets are remembered in your session, you will be able to delete the snippet from the same browser you posted from -
simply view the post and click the "delete" link.</p>
<p>In other cases, contact us and we will delete it for you.</p>
