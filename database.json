It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME - Geany only requires the GTK2 runtime libraries.\n\n## Features\n\n -   Syntax highlighting\n -   Code folding\n -   Symbol name auto-completion\n -   Construct completion/snippets\n -   Auto-closing of XML and HTML tags\n -   Call tips\n -   Many supported filetypes including C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal ([full list][1])\n  -  Symbol lists\n  -  Code navigation\n  -  Build system to compile and execute your code\n  -  Simple project management\n  -  Plugin interface (see [Plugins][2])\n\nGeany is known to run under Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS X, AIX v5.3, Solaris Express and Windows. More generally, it should run on every platform, which is supported by the GTK libraries. Only the Windows port of Geany is missing some features.\n\nThe code is licensed under the terms of the [GNU General Public Licence][3].\n\n## Geany's makers\n\n  - Colomban Wendling (maintainer, developer)\n  - Nick Treleaven (developer)\n  - Matthew Brush (developer)\n  - Enrico Tr\u00f6ger (developer)\n  - Frank Lanitz (translation maintainer)\n  - Lex Trotman (regular contributor, support guru)\n  - Ji\u0159\u00ed Techet (regular contributor, MacOS expert)\n  - and many other contributors, translators and patch writers\n\nTo contact all of us for general questions or feedback, please use the address &lt;team (at) geany (dot) org&gt;.

      "content": "Development\n==========\n\n## How to get started\n\nSince you clicked the link to get here, you most likely are a developer with C/C++ knowledge and wonder how to start contributing to the Geany project? You will find a short introduction here on how to start.\n\n### Introduce yourself\n\nThe first step is to introduce yourself so that we know you are there. Begin with subscribing to the [mailing lists][1] if you haven't done yet. Then write us a short mail to the [Geany Devel mailing list][2] and introduce yourself. We do not require any specific information about you. You decide what you will tell us.\n\n### Prepare for developing\n\n#### Read the HACKING file\n\nBefore you begin hacking on Geany, you should have a look on the [HACKING][3] file. Important things about coding style and many more are written down there.\n\n#### Surf through bugs and feature requests\n\nThere is a [bug tracker][4] which may contain bug reports or even feature requests which may already have a patch attached. To avoid redundant efforts, it's always a good idea to have a look first to see if there is already anything concerning the topic you want to work on.\n\n#### Surf through the mailing lists\n\nThere are also mailing lists archives where you can find out if topics have already been discussed. It's a good idea, to have at least a quick look there too. You can find them on the [mailing lists page][5].\n\n### Step in and dive into the Geany project\n\nThere are a few different points where you can step in and begin developing and improving Geany.\n\n#### Fix bugs\n\nYou can fix any bug you found in the [issue tracker][4] and either send a patch to the Geany-devel mailing list or attach the patch directly to the concerning bug. If you have an account om GitHub, you may also fork us and open a pull request accordingly.\n\n#### Add new features\n\nTake a feature you found on the issue tracker and decide if it is a feature which should be implemented in the Geany core or if it is better that it is implemented as a plugin. If you're not sure, you can discuss this on the Geany-devel mailing list. When you have decided to implement the feature in the Geany core, go ahead and clone or update the [current Git master of Geany][6], implement your feature and open a pull request on GitHub.\n\n#### Write a plugin\n\nWrite your own plugin? Yes!\nMore information about the separate Geany-Plugins project can be found on the [plugins page][7].\n\nIf you're going to write a plugin it would be cool if you write your README file in restructuredText. It can automagically be used for the plugins.geany.org website then.\n\n\n### Dive deeper\n\nWhen you like contributing to the Geany project and have fun with implementing things for Geany, you can even dive deeper.\n\n#### Fork us on GitHub\n\nYou can find Geany on GitHub at https://github.com/geany. A repository for Geany-Plugins can also be found there. Feel free to anonymously clone the repositories, change the code, diff it and send us the patches or even better - if you have an account at GitHub - fork it there and open a pull request for your changes.\n\n\n  [1]: /support/mailing-lists/\n  [2]: /support/mailing-lists/#geany-devel\n  [3]: /documentation/hacking/\n  [4]: https://github.com/geany/geany/issues\n  [5]: /support/mailing-lists/\n  [6]: /download/git/\n  [7]: /support/plugins/\n"

In particular these are:\n\n - GIT\n - Python docutils \n\nThe packages are named `git` and `python-docutils` on Debian and Fedora systems.\n\n## Writing Documentation\n\n### Check out current documentation from Git\n\nThe documentation is included in the source distribution. Thus, most current documentation is available in Geany's Git repository. To make sure you have the most recent version, check out the master branch of Geany as described on the [Git page][2] and then change to the directory `doc` in the Geany source tree.\n\n### Edit geany.txt\n\nYou will find a file called `geany.txt`, which is the basis of all documentation. It is written in [reStructuredText][3] (or \"reST\"). Feel free to improve this file as you like. To build the related HTML document to see what your changes look like, run:\n\n    make geany.html\n\nin the `doc` directory to create or update the generated HTML documentation. \n\n### Publish your changes for review and inclusion\n\nIf you are finished, just open a pull request on GitHub: https://github.com/geany/geany/pull/.\n\n\n  [1]: /support/mailing-lists/#geany-devel\n  [2]: /download/git/\n  [3]: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\n  [4]: https://geany.org/manual/dev/hacking.html#patches\n  [5]: https://github.com/geany/geany/pulls\n"

      "content": "Translate Geany and Geany-Plugins\n=============================\n\nIf you would like to translate Geany into another language, have a look at the [language statistics page][1] first to see if your desired language already exists. If it already exists, please read the Notes for updating translations section. Otherwise, get the Git version of Geany, change to the po directory and start the new translation with:\n\n    msginit -l ll_CC -o ll.po -i geany.pot\n\nFill in ll with the language code and CC with the country code. For example, to translate Geany into Italian you would type:\n\n    msginit -l it_IT -o it.po -i geany.pot\n\nThis will create a file it.po. This file can be opened with a text editor (e.g. Geany and its [PoHelper plugin][2] ;-)) or a graphical program like [PoEdit][3]. There are also several other GUI programs for working on translations.\n\nYou don't need to modify the file `po/LINGUAS`, it is regenerated automatically on the next build.\n\nWhen you have finished editing the file, check the file with:\n\n    msgfmt -c --check-accelerators=_ it.po\n\nPlease take care of menu accelerators(strings containing a \"\\_\"). The \"\\_\" character should also be in your translation. It also would be nice if these accelerators are not used twice within a dialog or sub menu.\n\nWhen you have finished your work - which doesn't mean you finished the translation, you will not have to work alone - send the file to the [translation mailing list][4] or directly to [Frank Lanitz][5] and he will add the translation to Geany then.\n\nAlternatively, you are also welcome to open a pull request with your translation updates on https://github.com/geany/geany/tree/master/po. You can also edit and start the pull request online.\n\nIt is a good idea to let any translator and Frank know before you start or while translating, because they can give you hints on translating and Frank can ensure that a translation is not already in progress.\n\nThe instructions here can be used also for translating Geany-Plugins (https://plugins.geany.org) which are managed in a separate code repository at https://github.com/geany/geany-plugins.\n\n## Notes for adding or updating translations\n\nIf you want to update an existing translation, please contact the [translation mailing list][4] and/or [Frank Lanitz][5] directly. He is supervising all translation issues and will contact the maintainer of the translation you want to update to avoid any conflicts.\n\nAlternatively, you are also welcome to open a pull request with your translation updates on https://github.com/geany/geany/tree/master/po. You can also edit and start the pull request online.\n\nTranslation statistics: https://www.geany.org/contribute/translation/statistics/\n\n\n  [1]: /contribute/translation/statistics/\n  [2]: https://plugins.geany.org/pohelper.html\n  [3]: https://www.poedit.net/\n  [4]: /support/mailing-lists/#geany-i18n\n  [5]: mailto:frank@frank.uvena.de\n"

      "content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n====================\n\n## Can I make Geany behave like Emacs/Vim?\n\nAs its default, Geany uses the standard GTK+ keybindings that most desktop users are \nfamiliar with. Although you can remap **most** keybindings to suit your taste, \nGeany cannot currently fully emulate Emacs or Vim, nor is it currently a goal \nof the core project developers to make it do so.\n\nAnd if really necessary, there is a Vim-mode plugin: https://plugins.geany.org/vimode.html\n\n\n## Can Geany show me multiple files at the same time?\n\nGeany provides a tabbed main editor window, but does not support \nsplit windows in the core. There is a Split Window plugin which \nshould work fine for viewing another document next to the main \neditor notebook. You can also run several instances of Geany simultaneously.\n\n\n## Does Geany have incremental search?\n\nCase-insensitive forward incremental search is via the `search field` in the toolbar. \nFor reverse incremental search, start a forward search then use your key for `Find Previous`.\n\n\n## Can I add custom filetypes by creating a filetypes.foo configuration file?\n\nYou can add a filetypes.Name.conf file with Geany 0.19 and use an existing \nfiletype's syntax highlighting and tag parsing. \nSee https://www.geany.org/manual/index.html#custom-filetypes.\n\n\n## How do I add full filetype support for language Foo?\n\nPlease see the [HACKING][1] document.\n\n\n## Can I extend Geany myself?\n\nYes! You can write your own plugins in C. You can also write Lua scripts \nfor Geany using the Lua plugin. See the [Plugins][2] page. \nAlso note the `Format->Send Selection` to command is useful for \npiping text through a script/external program.\n\n\n## How can I change the colors used for syntax highlighting?\n\nGeany reads the colors to use for syntax highlighting from filetype definition files. \nDetailed information on how to find and edit these files can be found in the [manual][3].\n\nThere is a tool for configuring color schemes, and a set of \ndark color schemes available can be found in the [Wiki][4].\n\n\n## The vertical scrollbar scrolls over the document and doesn't stop at the last line. What's wrong?\n\nFor Geany 0.13 and 0.14, this is enabled by default and allows appending text with the \nlast lines drawn at the top of the view. \nSince Geany 0.15, it is off by default and you can configure it in Geany's preferences dialog.\n\n\n## How can I contribute to Geany?\n\nSee [Contribute to Development][5].\n\n\n## Does Geany support editing files remotely through FTP or SSH?\n\nNo, Geany doesn't support any remote file editing. But you can easily mount \nremote filesystems through FTP, SSH or whatever with Fuse or LUFS. \nThis is even better because the remote filesystem will become available \nfor all your applications transparently.\n\nIf you have GVfs (Gnome >= 2.22) you may already have a Fuse mountpoint \nin `~/.gvfs/` which you can tell Geany to open remote files from, after \nmounting the connection from a Gnome program such as nautilus.\n\nTo avoid slow responsiveness, it is recommended to disable checking files \nfor changes to not query the file's modification time. To do so, open the \npreferences dialog and set `Disk check timeout` in the Files tab to 0 which \nwill disable it at all. Since Geany 0.16 disk file changes are always disabled \nfor remote files, so there is no need to disable this setting with Geany 0.16.\n\n\n## How can I change the language of the user interface?\n\nOn Windows: Download https://download.geany.org/contrib/geany_english.bat \nand put it into the `bin` subdirectory in the folder where you have Geany installed, \nnext to Geany.exe. Then open the file, edit the line `set LANG=C` and replace C \nwith your the language code of your locale (e.g. 'nl for Dutch, 'pt_BR' for \n'Portuguese Brazilian'). Save the file and execute it. It should start Geany \nwith the desired language assuming there is an exising translation. \nSee also the [list of available translations][6].\n\nOn non-Windows systems: Simply start Geany like this:\n\n`LANG=C geany`\n\nand of course, change \"C\" to your language code (see above) or set \nyour locale specific environment variables accordingly.\n\n\n## I get build errors after updating from Git, why?\n\nIt's possible it's a bug, but first try this:\n\n```\n\tmake distclean\n\t./autogen.sh\n```\n\nIf there are still errors, contact the mailing list.\n\n\n## Since Geany 0.16, GTK/GLib symbol completion is broken, why?\n\nThe symbol completion data for GTK/GLib symbols are just not in the default distribution anymore. \nInstead they can be downloaded separately besides other tag files.\n\nFor details about this change and download information, see [GTK symbol \ncompletion data removed from Geany 0.16][7].\n\n\n## How can I use urxvt or konsole as terminal application when executing files?\n\nOpen the preferences tab, Tools tab and enter the following \ncommand in the field Terminal:\n\n\turxvt -e sh -c\n\n\tor\n\n\tkonsole -e sh -c\n\n\tor (in case the above failed)\n\n\tkonsole --workdir . -e sh geany_run_script.sh\n\n\n## I changed my project/general indent prefs but my document still uses the old settings!\n\nThe project or general prefs for indentation only apply when opening new documents, \nbecause documents in your current session may have different overridden \nindent settings - i.e. you might want one document indented with tabs whilst \nanother is open with spaces indentation. See the [manual][8] for details.\n\n\n## How do you pronounce Geany?\n\n`\u0292e\u02d0ni\u02d0`\n\n(pronounced like \"genie\") But of course, it's up to you how you pronounce it.\n\n\n## How do I get my question answered?\n\nPlease first have a look at our [comprehensive manual][3]. \nIf that doesn't answer your question, the quickest and best way is to ask on the [mailing list][9]. \n\n\n[1]: /documentation/hacking/\n[2]: /support/plugins/\n[3]: /documentation/manual/\n[4]: https://wiki.geany.org/\n[5]: /contribute/development/\n[6]: /contribute/translation/statistics/\n[7]: /news/gtk-symbol-completion-data-removed-from-geany-016/\n[8]: https://www.geany.org/manual/index.html#indentation\n[9]: /support/mailing-lists/\n"

We also need:\n\n  - The version number of Geany\n  - The version number of GTK+ (can be printed with `geany -V`)\n  - Your OS details\n  - The filetype the bug occurred with (if applicable)\n\n### Other useful information\n\nGeany prints useful information on the command-line when run with the `-v` switch.\nThis can be useful to diagnose a bug.\n\nSometimes you might find a bug that only occurs with a certain configuration - in this case it can be helpful if you send us your `~/.geany/geany.conf` and any other concerned configuration file (where `~` is your home directory).\n\n### Getting a backtrace\n\nIf Geany crashed, it would also help us a lot if you can give us a backtrace made using `gdb`:\n\n  - Run `gdb /path/to/geany` (Note: the usual path can be found by running `which geany`)\n  - Type `run -v` (followed by any command-line arguments you used with Geany when the bug occurred) in the `gdb` prompt\n  - Reproduce the segfault - it will be caught by `gdb`\n  - Type `bt` and press enter if prompted\n\nSend us everything from the `run` command - thanks.\n\nIn some cases the backtrace may not be that useful.\nThis mostly happens when Geany was built without debug information, useful information was removed by using `-fomit-frame-pointer` or the binary was stripped (but it may still be worth sending it to us).\n\nIn this case it would be great if you could either:\n\n  - Get a backtrace from a debug package of Geany (if your distro has one) or\n  - Get a backtrace from a fresh Geany build with appropriate debug flags:\n\n     * `make clean`\n     * `./configure CFLAGS=-g`\n     * Then build Geany with `make`, etc.\n\nThis also prevents optimization flags (usually enabled e.g. `-O2`) from inlining static functions where the bug might be hiding.\n\nNote: a default source configure with gcc should include the `-g` debug flag, but on some systems CFLAGS is already set either by autoconf or in the shell environment, so it may need overriding.\n\n\n  [1]: /support/mailing-lists/\n"

I\nresigned as I don't have as many spare time as I want to do the job as good as\nit needs to be done. So someone else has a chance to do the job better and\nwith more love and free time. Luckily, Colomban volunteered for the job and we\nwere happy to have a new, cool project maintainer. Things won't change much,\nNick is still actively developing as well and probably I'll commit the one or\nother bit from time to time. The most obvious recent change is, that this\nrelease is already made by Colomban. Thank you!\n\n\\- Enrico",
